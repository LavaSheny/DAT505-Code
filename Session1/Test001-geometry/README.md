#### Test001-geometry ####
The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer. The library also provides Canvas 2D, SVG and CSS3D renderers in the examples.

#### Usage ####
```html
<script src="js/three.min.js"></script>
```
This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the document.body element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
```
